- Clean layout with hover effects on each project
- On-click redirection to individual project pages

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- HTML/CSS knowledge (for frontend styling)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Create a `static` folder in your project directory and place your image files (e.g., `rust.png`) inside.
2. In the `templates` folder, create an `index.html` file and paste the provided HTML structure for the projects.
